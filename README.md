create_N_pythagorean_triples(N)

Prints the first "N" Pythagorean triples by calculating them using a formula, works fairly quickly.

inefficient_create_N_pythagorean_triples(N)

Prints the first "N" Pythagorean triples by checking every triple until "N" triples are found, very slow and inefficient, as there is also no memory of what triples have been checked previously. Mostly written as to see how bad a method this was, as it may be a method I need/want to use later.

GCD algorithms

euclidean_algorithm(M,N,Show_Working)

Calculates and returns the GCD of M,N via the Euclidean algorithm, if Show_Working="Yes" it will show the method.

extended_euclidean_algorithm(M,N,Show_Working)

Calculates and returns [GCD , Bezout Identity of M , Bezout Identity of N] in a list of M,N via the Euclidean algorithm, if Show_Working="Yes" it will show the method.

Corollaries from GCD algorithms

least_common_multiple(N,M,Show_Working)

Calculates and returns the LCM of M,N via the Euclidean algorithm, if Show_Working="Yes" it will show the method.
